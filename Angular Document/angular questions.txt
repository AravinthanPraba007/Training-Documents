launch the application. The properties are:

imports – Modules that the application needs or depends on to run like,
          the BrowserModule that every application needs to run

             it, we'll see a clear error message in the browser console.
bootstrap – the root component that Angular creates and inserts into the
            index.html host web page. The application will be launched
